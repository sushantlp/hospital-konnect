          5: Determining your location
        </Header>
        <p>
          The Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services
          need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with
          our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the
          location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g.,
          latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your
          current location (i.e., we'll show you a list of nearby locations,
          friends and tips). This information is NOT shared in a form that is
          identified with you with others unless you are using a service that
          they offer. Also, the Services use your mobile device's ‘background
          location to provide the Services, including to send you notifications
          of tips/friends/plans/interesting things etc. near you. If you have
          ‘background location turned on, the Ballyhoo app will, from time to
          time, tell us about your device's location even if you are not
          directly interacting with the application.

          6: Sharing Location with the Ballyhoo app
        </Header>
        <p>
          Your real-time location is not shared with anyone on the Ballyhoo app
          in a form that identifies you.If you use a service from one of our
          merchants, write a tip, like or otherwise interact with a place, users
          may infer that you have been to that location. Some content, like
          tips, are time stamped and other users could use that information to
          infer when you were at a place even though tips can be posted when you
          aren't at the place you are leaving a tip about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your location data is ONLY shared with others when you proactively
          decide to "purchase" a deal from one of the merchants on our platform.
          "Others" in this scenario ONLY represents the owner of the service /
          product that you have purchased.

          shared with your Ballyhoo friends and is updated from time to time
          using your background location. You can turn off neighborhood sharing.
